# Pi Web - Development Notes

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run dev   # port 30141
```

Typecheck: `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`  
Lint: `npm run lint`  
Unit tests: `npm test`  
Browser E2E: `npm run test:e2e` (see below)  
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

### Browser E2E (`npm run test:e2e`)

Plain Playwright CLI — no editor or MCP integration required, so any agent (or CI)
verifies the same way it runs unit tests.

- Starts its own dev server on port 30142 with `distDir: .next-e2e`, so a `npm run dev`
  already running on 30141 is untouched.
- Sandboxed: `HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and the session cwd all live under
  `/tmp/pi-web-e2e` (`tests/e2e/sandbox.ts`), wiped at the start of each run.
  `PI_OFFLINE=1`, no credentials, no tokens spent.
- `tests/e2e/bash-session.spec.ts` covers the bash-only loop: `?cwd=` → `!command`
  in the composer → UI output → `/api/sessions` → JSONL on disk → reopen via `?session=`.
- Failure artifacts for any agent to read: `test-results/<test>/error-context.md`
  (ARIA snapshot), screenshot, video, `trace.zip`; HTML report in `playwright-report/`.
- Browser: bundled Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`). `PW_CHANNEL=chrome`
  reuses a locally installed Chrome instead.

```

**Session browsing** (read-only): reads `.jsonl` files through SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `lib/session-reader.ts` — no AgentSession created.  
**Sending a message**: `startRpcSession()` in `lib/rpc-manager.ts` creates an AgentSession in-process.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### A new session has no file until pi flushes it
Pi delays the first flush of a new session until an assistant message exists, so a run that just started is invisible to the disk scan behind `/api/sessions`. The sidebar list is derived purely from `.jsonl` files, so without help the session the user is actively watching cannot be found in the list until the turn ends.
- `AgentSessionWrapper.getLiveSnapshot()` builds a `SessionInfo`-shaped row from the in-memory `sessionManager`; `/api/sessions` merges those for ids the scan did not return. The snapshot returns `null` until a user message exists, otherwise an untouched "new chat" runtime renders a row that later vanishes.
- `SessionManager.open()` on a missing file returns an **empty history rather than throwing**, so a read path that opens the file blindly silently shows an empty chat. Session reads go through `openSessionManagerForRead()`, which falls back to the live runtime's manager. Rename and delete of an unflushed session likewise go through the runtime — there is no file to append to or unlink.
- The sidebar refetches the list once per running id it has no row for, because a session can start running between list fetches.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` → `toolNames[]`). For existing sessions, the active preset is inferred on mount via `get_tools` → `getPresetFromTools()`. When tools are fully disabled (`toolNames = []`), `rpc-manager.ts` passes an empty tool allow-list and forces `agent.state.systemPrompt = ""` after startup/reload/resource discovery.

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `lib/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### Effort and tool presets carry across sessions
The last explicitly picked effort (thinking) level and tool preset persist in `localStorage` (`APP_PREF_KEYS.thinkingLevel` / `.toolPreset`). New sessions seed their toolbar from them and `ensureNewSession` sends both at creation, so pi clamps a stored effort level the model lacks to the same-or-next-higher supported level (`clampThinkingLevel` in pi-ai) and returns the effective value, which the UI adopts. Existing sessions keep their own saved values until the user changes something. Picking "auto" clears the stored effort; pi's `defaultThinkingLevel` from settings.json then applies again.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so pi-web and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Per-session scroll restore must be saved before the render-phase reset
Switching sessions resets chat state *during render* (`sessionIdentity !== appliedIdentity` in `useAgentSession`), so the message list is emptied in the same commit — the browser clamps the container's `scrollTop` to 0 before any effect cleanup runs. Saving the position from an effect cleanup therefore records 0 for every switch (which restores as "top of the chat"). The save lives inside the render-phase reset block; an unmount-only cleanup covers ChatWindow remounts (there the DOM is still intact when cleanup runs). Positions and the lazy-load `visibleCount` are cached per session in module-level LRUs (`lib/scroll-memory.ts`): `scrollTop` is a pixel offset into the render window that existed at save time, so `visibleCount` must be restored with it or the offset lands on the wrong message. A viewport at the bottom is deliberately not saved — the restore path then falls back to scroll-to-bottom so users following the tail keep following it.

### The session load must have a deadline
Switching chats does **not** remount `ChatWindow` — `AppShell.handleSelectSession` deliberately keeps `sessionKey` stable so the input dock does not flash. That makes the single `GET /api/sessions/[id]` in `loadSession()` the only thing that ever clears `loading`, and the retry button only appears once the load *fails*. A bare `fetch` there is a hang away from leaving "loading session" on screen permanently, which is exactly what desktop users hit on the first switches after a cold start. It goes through `fetchWithRetry()` (`lib/fetch-timeout.ts`): a hung first attempt is abandoned, then retried once with a longer deadline — the server finishes its cold-start work regardless of the client giving up, so the retry usually lands warm.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as `/api/files`.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.
- The switcher also switches the *current* checkout's branch in place: `PUT /api/worktrees { cwd, branch }` → `switchBranch()` (local branch, or `checkout -b --track` when the name exists on exactly one remote). Branch names are validated to not start with `-` — they are passed as git argv, never through a shell. `POST /api/worktrees/fetch` runs `git fetch --prune` (with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so it fails fast instead of hanging on a credential prompt) and returns fresh local/remote-only branch lists.
- The sidebar worktree state is event-driven by nature (agent end, cwd switch) — branches checked out *outside* pi would go stale. `SessionSidebar` therefore polls `/api/worktrees` every 10 s while the tab is visible, on window focus, and when the dropdown opens; the `checkedWorktreeCwdsRef` guard keeps those background refetches silent.
- A branch already checked out in another worktree cannot be checked out again (git refuses); clicking it in the switcher jumps to that worktree instead.

### File access allow-list
- `/api/files` is intentionally not a general filesystem browser. Allowed roots come from session cwds, their resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` call `allowFileRoot()` when they make a new location browsable.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `lib/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those pure helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

### Desktop shell (Tauri)
- `lib/desktop-native.ts` is the only place the UI touches Tauri APIs; every entry point checks `isTauriDesktop()` and degrades to a web equivalent. Tauri commands are declared in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, their permissions in `src-tauri/permissions/desktop-shell.toml`, and both must be listed in `src-tauri/capabilities/desktop-dialog.json` or the call fails at runtime only.
- `/api/desktop/read-images`, `/api/desktop/save`, and `/api/files?...type=import` deliberately accept absolute paths selected by native dialogs, so the normal `lib/file-access.ts` source/destination allow-list cannot cover them (`save` still allow-lists its *source*). They require a loopback Host, normal request-security checks, and the per-process desktop token from `lib/desktop-api-auth.ts`. The Tauri shell passes the token to the packaged server and exposes it to the trusted WebView through the capability-scoped `get_desktop_api_token` command. Never fall back to a static token or User-Agent detection.
- `read-images` caps the file count at `MAX_ATTACHED_IMAGES` from `lib/image-attachments.ts`. Keep it derived from that constant; a separate literal silently 400s selections the composer considered valid.
- Open a local path with `explorer.exe` on Windows, never `cmd.exe /C start` — Rust's argument escaping does not apply to the cmd parser, so a legal path like `C:\src\R&D\x.txt` would split into commands.
- `lib/app-prefs.ts` owns every `localStorage` key. Theme is additionally mirrored into the app config dir via the `set_ui_theme` command, because the packaged server's port (and therefore the WebView origin, and therefore `localStorage`) can change between cold starts.
- `lib/workspace-state.ts` restores the last session/cwd/file tabs on cold start. URL params always win over the persisted workspace.
- `useDesktopConnection` polls `/api/home` only in Tauri to drive the offline banner. Its cleanup must stop in-flight probes from rescheduling, otherwise an unmount leaves a timer nobody owns and it pings forever.

### Upstream merge sentinels (not the same "fork" as session fork)
This repo is a fork of `agegr/pi-web` and periodically merges upstream. `components/fork-extractions.test.mjs` guards the failure mode that a clean merge can still be wrong: code this fork *moved* to another file reappears at its origin, or a fork change is silently reverted. Git does not track cross-file moves, so neither shows up in `tsc`, eslint, or the upstream suite.

When one of those assertions fails, the default is to restore the behaviour, not to delete the assertion. A failure saying a marker is "absent from the origin but also from the extraction targets — it looks deleted, not moved" means the feature is probably gone: that is exactly how the project-picker filter box was found missing after a restyle had left every project past the 7-row cap unreachable. Risk levels live in `scripts/fork-ownership.json`; the reasoning is in `docs/ownership-boundaries.md`.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.
